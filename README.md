Instructor website for course and lab material developed for course CNT 4104 Software Project in Computer Networks and expanded upon as a maintenance project the following semester in CEN 4935 Senior Software Project. This was my first Django project and was part of a case study of modern web technologies using Django and Bootstrap.
